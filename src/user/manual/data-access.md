
# Data Access

The Data Access tab allows for the control of _specific indicators_ AND __their reference dataset_ for individual users, groups or the public. When viewing the page, users will be able to see that indicators are listed multiple times and are available for “All Versions” and the “Latest Version” of the accompanying reference datasets. 

Users can locate the desired dataset and/or reference dataset by utilizing filtering features that are found throughout the data control functions of GeoSight.

Permissions can be adjusted on the right-hand side by selecting the box, or selecting one or multiple indicators and using the data button.

- Use the Indicator Filter to locate your desired indicator.

- Use the scroll wheel or Dataset Filter to reduce selection to your desired reference dataset.
