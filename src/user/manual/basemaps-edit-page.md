# Basemaps
The basemap creation page allows users to add, edit and manipulate basemaps that they have access to. Adding a basemap requires just a few elements.
1.	General – metadata including a name, description, URL and file type.
2.	Share – allows those with access to control, add and remove permissions for users, groups and the public.
