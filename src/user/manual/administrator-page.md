# The Administrator page

The administrator page is your first destination when creating content in GeoSight. It allows managing data, creating projects (dashboards), and managing users.

Users can control any element of data, projects or, layers that they own. Available elements are highlighted in blue text (as opposed to black text).
It is divided into three sections based on function.
