# Users and Groups

USERS

Most users, including all UNICEF staff and some consultants are able to access GeoSight with their UNCIEF email. 

In some cases, access may be needed for someone without a UNICEF email, including a consultant or government partner. Whatever the case may be, users can be created in the Users and Groups tab of the Access section.

GROUPS

Groups are a helpful way of aggregating users based on a common characteristic or shared attribute such as a Country or Regional Office, HQ Division or Role. This can be useful when controlling data, indicator, style or project access. By selecting groups as opposed to individual users, one can efficiently apply permissions to a large number of users. 

In cases where leads for specific groups want to add a large number of users to a group, they are able to import a roster instead of adding them individually. Here, users can import CSV files with users names, emails and permission level listed.

To add these users to a group, developers on the back-end should arrange an excel table with the following columns, First Name, Last Name, Email and Role Level (Viewer, Creator, Admin, etcâ€¦)

Once this CSV file has been finalized, users can import it from the group creation page. On this page users can select the file from their computer by clicking the Import Button. If correctly formatted, the users will be added to the group assuming they have GeoSight accounts.

Permissions must be updated manually if the user has already been added.
