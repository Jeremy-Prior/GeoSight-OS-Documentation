# Users and Groups

USERS

Most users, including all UNICEF staff and some consultants are able to access GeoSight with their UNCIEF email. 

In some cases, access may be needed for someone without a UNICEF email, including a consultant or government partner. Whatever the case may be, users can be created in the Users and Groups tab of the Access section.

GROUPS

Groups are a helpful way of aggregating users based on a common characteristic or shared attribute such as a Country or Regional Office, HQ Division or Role. This can be useful when controlling data, indicator, style or project access. By selecting groups as opposed to individual users, one can efficiently apply permissions to a large number of users.
