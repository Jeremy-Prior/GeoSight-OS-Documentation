# Context Layers
The context layer creation page allows users to add, edit and manipulate context layers that they have access to. Creating a context layer requires just a few elements, but comes with various customization options.

(Required)

1.	General – metadata including a name, description, API link and any permissions that may be needed to access the API. 

(Optional)

2.	Map - displays the context layer as well as errors in the event of an unsuccessful connection.

3.	Fields – allows users to examine and verify data columns in the dataset. 

4.	Style - determines the visualization and front-end display of a context layer.

5.	Labels -  determines if/how a label looks on a project for each administrative area.

6.	Share – allows those with access to control, add and remove permissions for users, groups and the public.
