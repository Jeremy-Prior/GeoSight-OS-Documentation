# Date and Time
Taking advantage of the date and time function in GeoSight allows users to utilize powerful analysis tools built into the program. From displaying historical data to highlighting the progression of indicator values through a time series widget, these tools can better inform users and allow them to understand their data beyond their physical locations.

## Data Management of Date-Time Values

In GeoSight, data is imported and managed through three dimensions as the graphic above illustrates:

1. Geography/Location
2. Indicator
3. **Date-Time**



See [Importing Data](https://unicef-drp.github.io/GeoSight-OS-Documentation/user/guide/importing_data/#long-format) for more details on how to configure date-time during the importing process.
