# Adding Basemaps
Adding basemaps are quite simple and only require a URL link to the source. 

It is only on rare occasion should users expect to add a basemap. Almost are basemaps are global and all main basemaps (including Satellite and OSM) have already been added.

1.	Navigate to the Basemap tab in the Admin Panel and select                              .

2.	Complete the General tab including the Name and Category tab.
    
    a.	Insert the source URL and determine the layer type (which be available on the source).

3.	Complete the description and icon (optional).

4.	Complete the share tab (optional).

5.	Save when complete
