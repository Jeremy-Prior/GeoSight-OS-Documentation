Indicators are a central part of GeoSight, individual pieces of relevant data are uploaded to the platform and in turn are visualized based on location to communicate that information to users. This applies for each dataset, values for the indicator are assigned to the given reference boundaries within the reference dataset.
Indicators are first created as empty shells. A name, color rule and basic information is applied before any data is imported. In pursuit of open data sharing and ease of access, Indicators are formatted so data can exist across multiple dimensions (time and geographical location/reference dataset) within one common indicator as opposed to repeating indicators for separate countries.

Similarly, this prevents the repetition of similar or the same indicators that may be created for different time periods, by users from different Country/Regional Offices. As such users are encouraged to use existing indicators and not create country specific ones.
